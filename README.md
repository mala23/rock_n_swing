Challenge: Rōnin Badge Test
---------------------------
Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Makers Array (MAMA) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following features:

- the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer will choose a random option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

As always you can use google your notes and everything else. This is a challenge for you and you only!

Rōnin BANZAI!!!!

Bonus 1: Multiplayer
Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other (yes there are two of them).
